# Safari 17.4 Canvas Fingerprinting Protections Bypass
This is an exploit for Safari 17.4 and lower that enables fingerprinting Safari users using `OffscreenCanvas` and `SharedWorker` even if fingerprinting protections are enabled. Apple seems to be unconcerned about this, so here it is!

Demo: https://detectincognito.com/whatAreYouSmokingApple.html

# The Vulnerability
As of Safari 17.4 on both macOS and iOS, canvas fingerprinting protections are not applied to `SharedWorker` and `ServiceWorker` web workers. Protections still apply to the `Worker` context, as well as in the main `window` context.

# The Proof of Concept
The included script runs a simple canvas fingerprinting technique using `OffscreenCanvas` in the `SharedWorker` scope. The output is then hashed. In addition, a function has been included that is able to detect if noise is being added to the `OffscreenCanvas` output for each included context. While the `ServiceWorker` context is also vulnerable to this attack, it is not implemented in order to keep the PoC as a single file.

To test the script, run it in Safari in a private window. The expected behavior is that each context should have the same hash value and all return `Noise: true`. However, as of Safari 17.4, `SharedWorker` will return a hash value that can aide in browser fingerprinting that is likely unique to the version of Safari used and maybe also to the hardware it's running on. While Safari is generally very resistant to being fingerprinted and this is certainly not alone enough to track the specific browser, this is not an ideal situation and must be addressed by Apple.

Please keep in mind that as of Safari 17.4, Safari only adds noise to canvases in private windows/tabs and not regular windows/tabs by default. To change this, you must change Safari's Settings under `Advanced` > `Use advanced tracking and fingerprinting protection` > `in all browsing`.
